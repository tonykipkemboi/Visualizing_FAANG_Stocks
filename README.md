# Visualizing FAANG Stocks from (Jan-Jun 2020)
I started self-teaching Python almost 2 months ago. I have learned at a rapid rate and actually enjoy it! 

This is a simple project that analyzes and visualizes FAANG stocks for a period of 6 months (Jan-June, 2020) to show their similarities and diferences. The time range is adjustable to fit any time period. I have also included a short thesis based on the correlations between the stocks.

I used the following packages:
#Pandas 
#Pandas-Datareader 
#Matplotlib
