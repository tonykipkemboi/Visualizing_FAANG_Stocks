# Visualizing_FAANG_Stocks
I started self-teaching Python almost 2 months ago. I  have learned at a rapid rate and actually enjoy it! 

This is a simple project that analyzes and visualizes FAANG stocks for a period of 6 months (Jan-June, 2020) to show their similarities and diferences. I have also included a short thesis based on the correlations between the stocks.

I used the following packages:
#Pandas 
#Pandas-Datareader 
#Matplotlib
